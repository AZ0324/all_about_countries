# Ethics Statement

## Purpose of Data Collection

The collected data is compiled in one dataset. This aims to save users' time by providing information in a single csv file, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple links.

## Data Sources and robots.txt

I have reviewed BBC and its `robots.txt` file to ensure that the data collection practices used are appropriate and ethical. The `robots.txt` file confirms that scraping is permissible under the site's guidelines, provided that we respect the restrictions specified.

## Collection Practices

The data collection practices are designed to be respectful and non-intrusive:

- The code does not disrupt the website's normal operation or cause any denial-of-service (DDoS) issues.
- The code does not bypass any password protections or other security measures.
- The scraping is limited to collecting data and does not involve any unauthorized access.

## Data Handling and Privacy

- The data collected does not include any personal user information.
- Only publicly available data is gathered from the website 
- The data is openly accessible, and the script does not handle any sensitive or private information.

## Data Usage

- The data collected is used solely for research and user convenience purposes.
- Users can use this data to research and gain information without having to click through multiple links.

**Note:** I do not claim ownership of the data scraped. The data is sourced from BBC country profiles and REST Countries API.
